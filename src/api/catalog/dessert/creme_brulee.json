  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 325ºF. Place four 1/2 cup ramekins or custard cups in a baking dish. Boil water in a kettle. Set aside.",
    "Heat cream in saucepan over medium-high heat until small bubbles form around edge of pan. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks and sugar until thick and lemon-coloured--about 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "Once cream is hot, gradually whisk into egg yolk mixture. Stir in vanilla. Pour mixture through sieve into ramekins, dividing evenly.",
    "Pour boiling water into baking dish to reach halfway up ramekins. Carefully place in oven.",
    "Bake until mostly set but with a slight jiggle in the centre, about 30 to 35 minutes for taller ramekins (2 inches high), and 25 to 30 minutes for shallow ramekins (1 inch high).",
    "Carefully remove ramekins from water. Cool on wire rack. When cool, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for least 2 hours and up to 2 days.",
    "Just before serving, sprinkle sugar evenly over surface. Using a mini torch or by broiling, heat until sugar melts and caramelizes. Serve immediately, or for a firmer texture, chill up to two hours before serving."
