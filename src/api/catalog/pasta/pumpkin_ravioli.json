    "Mound flour on a clean work surface and make well in center. Crack egg into center.",
    "Beat eggs lightly with a fork. Gradually incorporate flour into eggs, starting with inner rim of well.",

    "While dough is resting, cut pumpkin into small chunks, finely chop shallot, and mince garlic.",
    "Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped pumpkin and saut√© until pumpkin is tender and caramelized, about 10-15 minutes, adding shallot and garlic part way through.",
    "Transfer pumpkin to a bowl to cool slightly. Once cooled, mash until smooth.",
    "In a medium bowl, mix pumpkin with parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and allspice.",
    "Once dough is ready, roll into a thin sheet over a lightly floured surface.",
    "Scoop pumpkin filling out onto dough spaced 1-2 inches apart on the top half of the dough. Fold in half and press put air bubbles to seal in filling. Trim edges with a pasta cutter.",
    "Bring pot of salted water to a boil. Gently add ravioli to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface.",
